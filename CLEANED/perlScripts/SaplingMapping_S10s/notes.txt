SaplingMapping_S10s

File formats vary; going with s10nsYY.dat type

s10ns89dd notes: ***condition=1 changed to 6 for trees noted as down ***
s10ns95 adds "type" and "s10num95" to the very similar "sapnum"
2010 data all in .xls and .csv of a different format.

But wait...
IntermediateData\s10allyears4xls.dat
	renamed to s10allyears.csv
seems okay and works in Excel (except "E" quad labels get interpreted as exponentiation...)
